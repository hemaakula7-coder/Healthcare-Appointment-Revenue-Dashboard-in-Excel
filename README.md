# Healthcare-Appointment-Revenue-Dashboard-in-Excel
Excel Dashboard Project | Healthcare Appointment &amp; Revenue Analysis I recently built an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze healthcare appointment data and uncover insights related to revenue, doctor performance, and no-show behavior.
Key highlights from the dashboard:
 • Total appointments and appointment-based revenue tracking
 • Department-wise revenue analysis
 • Doctor-wise appointment distribution
 • No-show count and no-show rate to identify missed appointment impact
 • Daily appointment trend analysis
